## What types of information do we collect and store?

## Sharing of your personal information

1. Sharing with other Amnesty International entities; in addition to Amnesty International Limited, there are a number of separate Amnesty International organisations operating around the world who are authorised to carry our work. We may share your personal information with the Amnesty International organisation in your local country, who may then use your personal information in connection with its activities

2. Hosting and processing: the Website is hosted by a third party service provider and therefore any personal details you submit through the Website may be processed by that third party service provider.

All of these third party services providers will process your personal information only on Amnesty International's behalf and will be bound by strict confidentiality conditions. The disclosure of your personal information discussed above may involve transfer of that information outside the UK and European Union.
