**PACT definition:** identify four to five maps from Risk Mapping exercise that can help understand moments of risk that can be used to model a PACT in plenary, getting different maps, identifying which ones you as trainer want to use to do the thing, goal of pinpointing moments of risks that can be used to model a PACT: emergency moments that can be mitigated through connecting to your PACT. Explain that defining a PACT means choosing three contacts that are best suited to assist in a specific situation.

**Fishbowl exercise:** choose one participant to roleplay the PACT planner. Ask one of the report back participants to talk about one of the risk/threat issues/moments they identified in their risk map. Ask the PACT planner who they would choose as their three contacts in that situation (for example husband, friend and colleague), and ask three more participants to roleplay those PACT contacts. The PACT planner then has conversations with contacts, one at a time, about 1) what is the Panic Button, 2) why they have been chosen, and 3) what they should do upon receiving the alert. If it seems there could be a better contact choice (a lawyer might be better than the friend), replace that PACT contact with another roleplaying participant. Try roleplaying two fishbowls.

**Individual contacts:** all participants write on a flipchart who their three contacts would be in a certain scenario. They should outline who they are, why they chose them and what would be the main activities they expect from them. If time allows, ask participants to define two different PACT scenarios. Report back in plenary.

If you have more time, you could perform an actual asset/contacts mapping. In this kind of exercise you ask participants to list out (or represent in some way) the different kinds of assets or contacts they have. Thinking in terms of *assets* is helpful because it helps participants think about what those can people can actually do if something goes wrong. For example, participants can list out contacts at NGOs/INGOs, embassies, NHRIS, EU/AU/UN, reporters, local authorities, military contacts, police, funders, etc. Once they have mapped out the assets, ask participants to map out which ones would/could have enough power to help them. This will help participants with realizing which assets are most helpful, and which relationships should be nurtured as part of their security strategy.
