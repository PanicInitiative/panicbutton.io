**Welcome and introduction:** use this time to set rules (like hand signals, use of jargon etc). Ask participants who wish to remain anonymous come to you at first break: make sure no public sharing happens until then. Mention safe interaction: respect, self-care, etc. Clearly state your role as facilitator: they are the experts, they know their situation best, your role is to help guide them through the process.

**World map:** All participants stand up and fill the room. Explain that the floor is a map of the world, and that you're standing on country X. Ask participants to place themselves on a country of their choice (country of birth, favorite place, etc). Tell participants to talk ot each other to understand where to go. Embrace the confusion and wait for it to settle down. Ask participants to introduce themselves through their choice. Have everyone introduce themselves.

**Flower exercise:** Prepare paper flower centers (big circles) and petals (any shape) beforehand, in many colors. Hand out the centers to each participant, ask them to write or draw anything that represents them and stick centers on walls. During the training, facilitate reflection times (3 or more) where participants write important experiences on petals (learnings, insights, eureka moments) and attach them to their center.

**Roadmap agenda:** Before training begins, start drawing a roadmap on a big paper. Represent agenda items through visuals. As participants arrive, ask for their help in drawing the visuals â€” start introducing key phrases, like PACT. Draw a car on a sticky note: during the training, track progress by moving the car between activities.
