As soon as you receive the alert, you must organize a protest at the detention centre where you suspect the human rights defender is being held. Find at least 5 people who will accompany you to the detention centre. These can be any people in the room. Take a picture of your protest as proof that you have completed the task.

React fast when you receive the alert. Start by locating the suspected detention centre.

Once you have the picture you can reconvene with the other responders in your team and bring all the evidence of each task to the Game Masters.
