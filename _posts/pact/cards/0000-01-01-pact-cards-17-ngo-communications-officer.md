As soon as you receive the alert, your task is to give an interview to the press. Record your brief statement on a mobile phone camera. You will need to ensure that you include all key information about the defender and the case so prepare first by asking the right questions when setting up your PACT.

React fast when you receive the alert. Record a short video statement to the press. Once you have the video you can reconvene with the other responders in your team and bring all the evidence of each task to the Game Masters.
