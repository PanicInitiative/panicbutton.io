You can download Panic Button onto your mobile phone [here](https://panicbutton.io/#download).  The installation should begin automatically; simply follow the instructions on your phone. 

Once the app has been downloaded, you can find it in your Application list under the name Panic Button. Once it has been installed you can open it by searching for the Calculate! icon among your apps. Panic Button will walk you through the set up and functions of the app.

If you are taking part in the private beta testing and have difficulties installing the app, please see the [FAQ](https://panicbutton.iilab.org/help/help-using.html#help_using_faq) or [contact us directly](mailto:support@panicbutton.io) for support.
