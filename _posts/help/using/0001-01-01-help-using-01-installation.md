You can download Panic Button onto your mobile phone [here](https://panicbutton.io/#download). Installation should begin automatically; simply follow the instructions on your phone. 

Once the app has been downloaded, you can find it in your Application list under the name Panic Button (look for the PB icon). After you have fully set-up the app this icon will change to a disguised version. Look for the Calculate! icon among your apps. 

If you are having difficulties installing the app, please see the [FAQ](https://panicbutton.io/help/help-using.html#help_using_faq) or [contact us directly](mailto:support@panicbutton.io) for support.
