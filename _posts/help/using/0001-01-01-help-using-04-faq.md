**1. I’ve downloaded the app but I can’t find the app on my phone, where is it?**

Search amongst your apps for a new app with the PB icon. This icon will show until you have finished setting up the app, after which it will be appear with the Calculate! icon.


**2.	How can I reset my passcode if I have forgotten it?**

Unfortunately there is no way to re-set the passcode except by reinstalling the app. You can reinstall the app by downloading it again from the original link.

**3.	How do I turn of the alert when it is sending?**

To turn off the alert you will need to enter the app settings. 

Enter the app, unlock the app disguise and enter your pin number. Once on the home page you can turn of the alerts by pressing the button **Stop Alerting**

Once you have turned off the alert the status bar will change from ‘Alert Sending’ to ‘Alert Ready’ again.

**4.	I have triggered the alert but my contacts are not receiving any messages, what does this mean?**

Firstly, confirm you triggered the alert. Did you feel the vibrate letting you know that the alert was successfully triggered?

Secondly, check that you have phone credit and that network coverage is available. You can test this by sending a regular SMS message and checking with a contact that it was received.

If you have checked all of the above and it still fails to work you may be experiencing a bug. As Panic Button is in a Beta testing phase we expect that the app will still have technical bugs on some mobile devices. You can help us to fix these problems by reporting a bug to us [**here**](https://report.panicbutton.io/).

**5.	My contacts are receiving an alert message but are not seeing my location, what should I do?**

In order to send the map link with your location, your mobile devise must be able to connect with the phone’s GPS or alternatively detect a nearby cellphone tower.

Ocassionally the phone is unable to do either in which case your alert message will appear but without sending your location.

If this is happening to you frequently check the following:

1.	That you have enabled GPS through your phone’s settings. See [**here**](http://www.droid-life.com/2013/01/30/how-to-enable-gps-and-other-location-services-beginners-guide/) for help on how to do this.
