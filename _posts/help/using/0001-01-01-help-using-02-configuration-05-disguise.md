Panic Button stays hidden on your phone by looking like a simple calculator. 

After you have set up the app, you will see the calculator disguise each time you open the app. The app set-up wizard will teach you how the disguise works. 

Donâ€™t forget to practise so that you remember how to dismiss the disguise and access your settings screen!
