Consider the context of your message carefully. The message should be short but clearly communicate the urgency of your situation.  

Things to think about:

- It is best to agree the content of this message in a conversation with your contacts. You may want to decide a code word or phrase instead of saying ‘help!’ . The most important thing is that your contacts know what the message means and how to act on it.
- You won't have time to change a message in an emergency, so make sure your alert message would work in all situations.
- Remember to enable GPS in your phone settings if you want your location to be sent to your contacts with the alert.
