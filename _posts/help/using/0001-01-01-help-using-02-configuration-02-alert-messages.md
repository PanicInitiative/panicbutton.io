It is best to agree the content of this message in a conversation with your contacts. You may want to decide a code word or phrase instead of saying ‘help!’ . The most important thing is that your contacts know what the message means and how you would like them to act.

If you have GPS enabled your message will attach a Google Map link in the SMS that your contacts receive. This message will send every 5 minutes by default. You can change the frequency of the messages when the app is alerting. Enter the app home screen by dismissing the facade screen and entering your PIN. From the home screen click Settings> >. 

Things to think about:

- You won't have time to change a message in an emergency so make sure your alert message makes sense in a number of potential situations. It is a good idea to change it routinely before entering a situation in which you may be at risk.
- Remember to enable GPS in your phone settings if you want your location to be sent to your contacts.
