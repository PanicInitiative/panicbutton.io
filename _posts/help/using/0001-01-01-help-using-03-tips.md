It might sound obvious but its important that you learn and practice how to trigger the alert. When you need to use the app, it will likely be in a ‘panic’ moment and you may have very little time to react. The more that you practice triggering the alert, the more likely you will be able to trigger it in an emergency. 

We recommend doing a dry run of the alert with your contacts. You could try this as a game to practice triggering the alert at unexpected moments. For example, you could agree that for one day every time you see a red car you will trigger the alert as fast as possible. You can then time how long it takes for your contacts to see the alert and respond. 

At the end of the day, meet with your contacts and debrief about what worked and what could be improved to ensure you are all prepared to act in a real emergency.
