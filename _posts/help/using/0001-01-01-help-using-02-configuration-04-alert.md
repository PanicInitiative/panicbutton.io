There are two ways to trigger the alert. Learn and practise by following the app set-up wizard! When you have learnt how it works, practise trying to trigger the alert in different situations: on a bus, in the office, in the dark. That way you will be confident to trigger the alert in a real emergency.

_**1.	The power button**_

Panic Button is unique because you can trigger the alert from the phone's power button. This means you can do it secretly - for example, from inside a jacket pocket. 

To trigger the alert repeatedly press the power button fast until you feel a vibration.

_**2.	The calculator screen**_ 

Alternatively, you can trigger the alert directly from the app's disguise screen.

To trigger the alert repeatedly press a button on the calculator fast until you feel a vibration.
