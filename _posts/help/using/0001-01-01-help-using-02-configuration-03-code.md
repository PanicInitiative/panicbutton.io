Create a four digit pincode that you will remember. This pincode is needed to dismiss the disguise and access the app settings. 

Remember, the disguise aims to delay the discovery of the application for as long as possible while it sends location updates to your chosen contacts. However, this does not prevent a competent attacker from accessing the content of your messages or the telephone numbers your chosen contants.

**Your pin code will NOT be needed to trigger the alerts in an emergency!**

It is important you remember your pincode. If you forget it you will need to reinstall the app and start all over again with the set-up!
