Create a four digit pincode that you will remember. This pincode is needed to access the app settings and keep your emergency contact details & messages private. 

**Your pin code will not be needed to trigger the alerts in an emergency!**

It is important you remember your pincode. If you forget it you will need to reinstall the app and start all over again with the set-up!
