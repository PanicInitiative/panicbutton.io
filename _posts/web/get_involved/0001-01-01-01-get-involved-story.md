We are a growing community and always on the look out for people who want to contribute to the app and project! Are you a human rights defender, activist, journalist who would like to test the app and help us to improve it to better meet your needs? Are you a developer of designer with some extra time and skills to lend? Or do you simply care about human rights and want to help improve a tool that will directly support thousands of individuals around the world who face threats because they stand up for freedom of expression and the rights of others. If you are, we want to hear from you!

Here are some of the ways to get involved:

1. Sign up to partipate in our private beta pilot! 

We are looking for Android users around the world to help us to pilot the very first release of the Panic Button app. We are particularly looking for human rights defenders, activists and journalists who would like to test the app and send us feedback about how we can improve it for your work.
