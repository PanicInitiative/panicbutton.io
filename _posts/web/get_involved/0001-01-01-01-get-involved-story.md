New technologies – such as social media and mobile Internet – have **fundamentally changed how we shed light on and respond to human rights abuses.** Today, almost anyone with a mobile phone can be a human rights monitor and challenge the abuse of power by capturing and sharing documentation of abuses as they happen.

And yet, technology brings new threats. Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) are becoming a battleground as journalists, citizens and  activists seek inventive ways to protect the secure flow of information while governments invest in sophisticated technologies to intercept, monitor,  track and censor those who challenge them.

Panic Button was the product of an [open design process that we kicked off with OpenIDEO](http://somewhere) in early 2012. I have been amazed at how many people along the way have devoted their spare time and talents to the simple but transformational idea of creating a mobile alert system for activists. The project has closely involved 648 challenge participants, more than 50 Designers, 30 Activists and 18 Developers since then.
