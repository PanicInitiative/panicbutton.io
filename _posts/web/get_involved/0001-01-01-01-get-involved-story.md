We are a growing community and always on the look out for people who want to contribute to the app and project.

Are you a human rights defender, activist, journalist who would like to test the app and help us to improve it to better meet your needs? Are you a developer of designer with some extra time and skills to lend? Or do you simply care about human rights and want to help improve a tool that will directly support individuals around the world who face threats because they stand up for freedom of expression and the rights of others. If you are, we want to hear from you!

Here are some of the ways you can get involved:

1. [Sign up] to partipate in the private beta pilot 

We are looking for Android users around the world to help us to pilot the very first release of the Panic Button app. In particular we want to hear from human rights defenders, journalists and others who face risks due to their work. [Sign up here]LINK to test the app and feedback to us about how we can improve it for you. 

2. Contribute to making app improvements 

Have an idea about how we can improve the app? All our code, designs and feature ideas can be found on our [Github repo](https://github.com/TeamPanicButton/PanicButton). From time to time we have also run codejams, hackathaons and open design days and have invited developers, designers, videomakers, trainers and security experts to help us work through specific design and implementation challenges.
