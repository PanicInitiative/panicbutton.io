The Panic Button project is an initiative of Amnesty International in collaboration with Frontline Defenders, iilabs and the engine room, who provide ongoing advice and input on design and implementation of the project.

Panic Button belongs to a wider community of partners and advisors. Special thanks go to the network of human rights activists from more than ten countries who have worked with us over the months to collaboratively design the app and have given many hours feeding back on the usability and functionality of the app.

A huge thanks is also owed to the many volunteer programmers and designers who have given their time to develop the app. Developers can help us continue to improve the app by contributing to the open-source project on Github. 

Panic Button received seed funding from the Ford Foundation and was awarded further funds to develop and pilot the app from the Google Global Impact Challenge.
