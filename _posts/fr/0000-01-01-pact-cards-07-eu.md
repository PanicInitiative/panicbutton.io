K11-hard_mode: '- Confirm that the HRD fits the definition (i.e. ask questions about whether the HRDs believe about some controversial issues like access to abortions, LGBTI rights, etc), claiming that the EU (nor any embassy) can possibly get involved in the case unless they have assurances that the person is in fact an HRD and therefore believes in all rights. - Is there history between the HRD and the EU or DipCore? For example, has the HRD ever been invited to EU or Embassy events? Has anyone in the DipCore ever visited their office or made public appearances with them? - Claim that the EU (nor any embassy) can''t take action unless there''s already an Urgent Action or Public statement by a large, well-respected human rights NGO/INGO.'

- Why is the person an HRD? Do they actually fit the UN definition of an HRD?
- A good explanation of what happened. For example the circumstances of the disappearance/detention, including how they found out about it
- Have they verified the situation?
- Information about the response plan that has been set up. Who is involved? How would the work of the EU fit into other responses that are being planned?
