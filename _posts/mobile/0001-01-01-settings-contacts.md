Security Tips

 - Think about who can practically assist you  - there is no point someone knowing you are in trouble if they are not in a position to help you
 - Create a PACT with the contacts you choose - make sure they agree and are PREPARED to ACT
 - Be aware of the risks - how might your chosen contact be put at risk?
