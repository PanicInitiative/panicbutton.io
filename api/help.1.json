All SMS messages may be recorded by the service provider, and may be read by the strong adversaries.</li>  <li>When you need to communicate something that is sensitive, consider creating a coded system with trusted colleagues. For example, “X” could mean you’re in danger, and “Z” could mean you’re safe. “Tree” could mean you want to meet up. “Banner” could be a cafe you can meet at.”</li>  <li>If you or your source are threatened, and you must communicate via SMS, you should both use an encrypted SMS application. If it is really sensitive information, it is better to find an alternative method to communicate and even avoid digital communications if possible. </li>  <li>If possible, carry more than one phone and ensure that at least one is anonymous so that sensitive communications cannot be tied to your personal identity. This means not registering the SIM card to yourself and using pre-paid phones that do not require you to give personal details or billing information to your network provider.</li>  <li>If possible, carry more than one phone and ensure that at least one is anonymous so that sensitive communications cannot be tied to your personal identity. Try not to register the SIM card to yourself and use pre-paid phones that do not require personal details or billing information.</li>  <li>Never keep a record of your SMS messages on your phone. However, it is good to be aware that even if you delete your messages, they may still be accessed by strong adversaries if they go directly to your service provider.</li>  <li>Where possible, memorize the telephone numbers of close colleagues or sources so that this information is not easily found on your telephone. Remember to delete numbers this in your call history although this information could still be found by going to the service provider.</li></ul><p>SOURCE: This list of top tips was taken and adapted from the Story Maker App Lessons on mobile security.

For example, don’t pick someone who you know regularly leaves their phone at home in which case your alert may not be seen for hours.</li>  <li>Make sure that the three emergency contacts complement each other. Don’t pick three people in a single organization or location. </li>  <li>Consider who can realistically help you in an emergency. Your close colleagues may know the situation but they could also be at high risk or even be arrested with you. Pick someone whose reputation and influence will help to secure your release. For example, a lawyer or community leader.</li>  <li>Always remember, if the groups who are threatening you have partnerships with the telecommunications companies in your country or have access to equipment that allows them to intercept telecommunications, they can easily discover the telephone numbers of your recipients. Make sure you that your contacts understand these risks. </li>  <li>It is a good idea to include one person who is at low risk of retaliation. For example, it may be an older family member who is less likely to be targeted by the authorities. Alternatively, is there a close and trusted member of your network outside the country? </li>  <li>While there may be international contacts in your network think carefully before selecting someone far away. Will they be able to respond quickly to an alert? Consider timezone differences and also whether the person you choose is familiar enough with your context to get in touch with others who can physically assist.</li></ul><p><img src=\"http://panicinitiative.github.io/panicbutton.io/media/Screenshot_2014-03-06-12-48-51.png\" alt=\"Setting Up Contacts\" /></p>"
