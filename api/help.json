All SMS messages may be recorded by the service provider, and may be read by the strong adversaries.</li>  <li>When you need to communicate something that is sensitive, consider creating a coded system with trusted colleagues. For example, “X” could mean you’re in danger, and “Z” could mean you’re safe. “Tree” could mean you want to meet up. “Banner” could be a cafe you can meet at.”</li>  <li>If you or your source are threatened, and you must communicate via SMS, you should both use an encrypted SMS application. If it is really sensitive information, it is better to find an alternative method to communicate and even avoid digital communications if possible. </li>  <li>If possible, carry more than one phone and ensure that at least one is anonymous so that sensitive communications cannot be tied to your personal identity. This means not registering the SIM card to yourself and using pre-paid phones that do not require you to give personal details or billing information to your network provider.</li>  <li>If possible, carry more than one phone and ensure that at least one is anonymous so that sensitive communications cannot be tied to your personal identity. Try not to register the SIM card to yourself and use pre-paid phones that do not require personal details or billing information.</li>  <li>Never keep a record of your SMS messages on your phone. However, it is good to be aware that even if you delete your messages, they may still be accessed by strong adversaries if they go directly to your service provider.</li>  <li>Where possible, memorize the telephone numbers of close colleagues or sources so that this information is not easily found on your telephone. Remember to delete numbers this in your call history although this information could still be found by going to the service provider.</li></ul><p>SOURCE: This list of top tips was taken and adapted from the Story Maker App Lessons on mobile security.

Your close colleagues may know the situation but they could also be at high risk or even be arrested with you. Pick someone whose reputation and influence will help to secure your release.

Make sure you that your contacts understand these risks. </li>  <li>It is a good idea to include one person who is at low risk of retaliation. For example, it may be an older family member who is less likely to be targeted by the authorities.

You could try this as a game to practice triggering the alert at unexpected moments. For example, you could agree that for one day every time you see a red car you will trigger the alert as fast as possible. You can then time how long it takes for your contacts to see the alert and respond. </p><p>At the end of the day, meet with your contacts and debrief about what worked and what could be improved to ensure everyone is prepared to act in a real emergency.</p>",
