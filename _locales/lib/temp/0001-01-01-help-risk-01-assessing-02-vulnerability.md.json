  "0001-01-01-help-risk-01-assessing-02-vulnerability.md---content": "\nVulnerability to a threat depends on your circumstances and how well equipped you are to stop the threat from harming you if it becomes reality. \n\nSome factors that increase or reduce vulnerability include access or lack of access to:\n\n - Effective and secure means of communication\n - Safe, ground transportation\n - Proper locks or other physical security protections for a house or office\n - Support from others (a network or system) in the event of attack \n\n\nVulnerabilities and threats also vary according to gender, age and other factors.\n\nTo reduce your vulnerability it is important to increase your capacity to defend against and respond to a threat by having a clear and effective security plan in place. For starters, it is a good idea to develop and maintain an up-to-date checklist that covers the following:\n\n - Managing information (physical and digital) in a secure manner\n - Maintaining a contact list and network that can provide information about attacks and will advocate on your behalf should you be victimized \n - Deciding who your emergency contacts are in the event of a threat \n - Deciding who should know who your emergency contacts are (and making sure to let them know)\n - Making a recovery plan (should be tested in practice)\n\n\nSOURCE: This information was taken and adapted from the Frontline Defenders Protection Manual for Human Rights Defenders. Useful examples to help you create your own security checklist, as well as further information about how to prevent or respond to attacks can be found in the original [Frontline Protection Manual](http://www.frontlinedefenders.org/manuals/protection).\n"
