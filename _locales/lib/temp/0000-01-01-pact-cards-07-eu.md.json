You coordinate the diplomatic core on HRD support and response, in accordance with the EU HRD Protection Guidelines. The support you provide ranges from encouraging embassies for emergency visas, office visits, press statements, trial monitoring, etc.",

For example, has the HRD ever been invited to EU or Embassy events? Has anyone in the DipCore ever visited their office or made public appearances with them? - Claim that the EU (nor any embassy) can't take action unless there's already an Urgent Action or Public statement by a large, well-respected human rights NGO/INGO.",

For example the circumstances of the disappearance/detention, including how they found out about it\n- Have they verified the situation?\n- Information about the response plan that has been set up. Who is involved? How would the work of the EU fit into other responses that are being planned?  \n"
