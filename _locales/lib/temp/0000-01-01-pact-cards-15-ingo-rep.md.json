You try to maintain good connections with members of civil society and part of your remit is realising an organisational priority on HRD protection (both preventative and responsive).",

Is there consent to use that photo? - Background information about the work of the HRD (i.e. geographic, thematic, target groups, etc). You can argue that the work of the HRD has to fit into the strategic direction of the INGO or you wouldn’t be able to prioritise putting out a statement. - You can explain  that you are worried they will want more than a public statement but that you and your team wouldn’t have the capacity to do any further work.",

Who is all involved? How would the public statement fit into other responses that are being planned?  \n- Proof that the HRD has given their informed consent to be named in a public statement\n- What would be the impact of a public statement on the situation for the HRD? Is there a risk in naming them in a public statement? Does this risk outweigh the benefits?\n"
