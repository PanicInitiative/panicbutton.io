Security Tips

 - Think about who can practically assist you  - there is no point someone knowing you are in trouble if they are not in a position to help you
 - Make a plan with your chosen contacts so that they are prepared to act fast. 
 - Be aware of the risks - how might your chosen contact be put at risk?
