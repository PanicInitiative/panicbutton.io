  "0001-01-01-help-risk-01-assessing-01-threat.md---content": "\nSometimes a threat may be explicit. Not all explicit threats will lead to an incident. After all threatening you may be easy, but attacks are expensive. Other times, a threat will be implicit. You may be concerned that you are under threat because of another attack on someone else.\n\nIt is good to think about what the person or group threatening you aims to achieve and whether their motive is great enough for them to take the risk. Think about this in terms of what they have to gain versus what they have to lose. This will help you to decide if the risk of the threat becoming a reality is low, medium, or high.\n\nFive steps to assessing a threat:\n\n1. Establish the facts surrounding the threat(s).\n2. Establish whether there is a pattern of threats over time.\n3. Establish the objective of the threat (what they have to gain)\n4. Establish who is making the threat and what they might have to lose\n5. Make a reasonable conclusion about whether or not the threat can be put into action (are they equipped enough?)"
