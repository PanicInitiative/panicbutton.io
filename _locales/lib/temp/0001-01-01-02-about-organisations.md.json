  "0001-01-01-02-about-organisations.md---content": "\nThe Panic Button project is an initiative of Amnesty International in collaboration with key advisors and partners including [Front Line Defenders](http://www.frontlinedefenders.org/), [iilab](https://iilab.org/) and [the engine room](https://www.theengineroom.org/).\n\nPanic Button also belongs to a wider community of advisors and friends. Special thanks go to the network of human rights activists from more than ten countries who have worked with us over the months to collaboratively design the app and have given many hours feeding back on the usability and functionality of the app.\n\nA huge thanks is also owed to the many programmers and designers who have donated their time and skills to develop the app over the past two years. We are especially grateful to the [OpenIDEO community](http://www.openideo.com/challenge/amnesty/brief) for kick-starting the project and to [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com/) who generously helped to develop the first working prototype of the app.\n\nPanic Button was supported with seed funding from the [Ford Foundation](http://www.fordfoundation.org/) and was awarded a further £100,000 to build on and pilot the app thanks to the [Google Global Impact Challenge](http://livewire.amnesty.org/2013/05/22/a-lifeline-for-activists/).\n\n<div markdown=\"0\">\n<div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\n<div class=\"bordertb\">\n\t<div class=\"col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 text-center\">\n\t\t<img src=\"{{ site.JB.BASE_PATH }}/images/amnestylogo.jpg\" class=\"col-sm-4 col-xs-12\" style=\"margin-right:-4px; float:none; display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; border: none;\">\n\t\t<img src=\"{{ site.JB.BASE_PATH }}/images/iilab-logo-new-color-4.png\" class=\"col-sm-4 col-xs-12\" style=\"margin-right:-4px; float:none; display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; border: none;\">\n\t\t<img src=\"{{ site.JB.BASE_PATH }}/images/pasted_image_at_2013_12_18_12_36pm.png\" class=\"col-sm-4 col-xs-12\" style=\"margin-right:-4px; float:none; display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; border: none;\">\n\t\t<img src=\"{{ site.JB.BASE_PATH }}/images/frontline-logo.png\" class=\"col-sm-4 col-xs-12\" style=\"margin-right:-4px; float:none; display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; border: none;\">\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\n<div class=\"bordertb\">\n\t<div class=\"col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 text-center\">\n\t\t<img src=\"{{ site.JB.BASE_PATH }}/images/img-11.png\" style=\"border: none;\">\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>     \n"
