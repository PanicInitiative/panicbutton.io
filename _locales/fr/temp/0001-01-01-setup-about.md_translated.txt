Panic Button turns your mobile phone into a secret alarm for when you're in trouble.

**How Does Panic Button Work?**

    * TAKE TIME to set-up Panic Button somewhere safe and quiet
    * Create a plan with your contacts so that they are PREPARED to ACT
    * CHECK you are ready and that your mobile phone has credit and battery
    * ACTIVATE Panic Button in an emergency by rapidly pressing the phone's power button
    * Your network will receive an SMS and regular updates of your location helping them to ACT FAST

The Panic Button project is an initiative of Amnesty International in collaboration with key advisors and partners including Frontline Defenders, iilab and the engine room.
