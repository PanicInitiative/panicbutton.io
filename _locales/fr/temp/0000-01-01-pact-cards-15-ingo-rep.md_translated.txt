- A good explanation of what happened,  the circumstances of the disappearance/detention (including about how they found out about it, i.e. the Panic Button)
- Information about the response plan that has been set up. Who is all involved? How would the public statement fit into other responses that are being planned?  
- Proof that the HRD has given their informed consent to be named in a public statement
- What would be the impact of a public statement on the situation for the HRD? Is there a risk in naming them in a public statement? Does this risk outweigh the benefits?
