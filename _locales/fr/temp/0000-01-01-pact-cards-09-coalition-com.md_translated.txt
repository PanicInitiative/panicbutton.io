- A good explanation of what happened, the circumstances of the disappearance/detention, etc. (including about how they found out about it, i.e. the Panic Button)
- Why do they think that the disappearance/detention was connected to the fact that the person is actually a HRD?
- Has the HRD given consent for the information about the incident to be communicated so widely?
- Is there any risk in naming the HRD in the communication?
