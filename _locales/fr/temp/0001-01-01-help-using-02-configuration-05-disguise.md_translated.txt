Panic Button stays hidden on your phone by looking like a simple calculator.

After you have set up the app, you will see the calculator disguise each time you open the app. The coloured bar at the top lets you know whether the alert mode is 'active' (shows red) or 'on standby' (shows yellow).  You will learn more about how the disguise works in the app's setup wizard.

Donâ€™t forget to practise so that you remember how to get past the disguise and access your settings screen!
