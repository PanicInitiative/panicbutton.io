  "0001-01-01-help-using-00-security.md-content": "\nIt is important that you understand and assess the trade-offs you make in your security when using Panic Button. \n\nAlways remember: Panic Button only improves your safety when your contacts are in a position to act. \nThe disguise aims to delay the discovery of the application for as long as possible while it sends location updates to your chosen contacts. However, this does not prevent a competent attacker from accessing the content or recipient of your messages, including your location. \n\nThe mobile networks that allow you to send an SMS are not built to protect your privacy or the content of your messages. This is true for all calls and SMS communications you make, including SMS alerts sent by Panic Button. \nThis present you and your contacts with direct risks if the groups who are threatening you have partnerships with the telecommunications companies in your country or have access to equipment that allows them to intercept telecommunications.\n\nIf you are using Panic Button in your work, we encourage you to visit our [help section](https://panicbutton.io/help/help-risk.html) on assessing risks and using your mobile phone more safely. There is also a list of [suggested resources](https://panicbutton.io/help/help-reading.html) where you can learn about additional tools and strategies to mitigate against the risks of using a mobile phone.\n\nFurther security information about how Panic Button attempts to protect users against different types of adverse situations can be found [here](https://github.com/iilab/PanicButton/blob/master/docs/SECURITY.md).\n\n\n"
