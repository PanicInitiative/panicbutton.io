This icon will show until you have finished setting up the app, after which it will be appear with the Calculate! icon.\n\n\n**2.\tHow can I reset my passcode if I have forgotten it?**\n\nUnfortunately there is no way to re-set the passcode except by reinstalling the app. You can reinstall the app by downloading it again from the original link.\n\n**3.\tHow do I turn off the alert when it is sending?**\n\n To turn off the panic button please follow these steps:\n \n1/ Open the application (It should be called \"Calculate!\")\n\n2/  A calculator should appear.\n\n3/  Click and hold any button of the Calculator (for instance 5) for 5 seconds.\n\n4/  Enter your secret PIN (which you chose during the setup)\n\n5/  Then click on \"Stop Alerting\". That's it! Now your phone should stop sending the SMSes.\n\nOnce you have turned off the alert the status bar will change from ‘Alert Sending’ to ‘Alert Ready’ again.\n\n![The application status bar](/media/Screenshot_2014-03-06-12-52-19.png)\n\n**4.\tI have triggered the alert but my contacts are not receiving any messages, what does this mean?**\n\nFirstly, confirm you triggered the alert. Did you feel the vibrate letting you know that the alert was successfully triggered?\n\nSecondly, check that you have phone credit and that network coverage is available. You can test this by sending a regular SMS message and checking with a contact that it was received.\n\nIf you have checked all of the above and it still fails to work you may be experiencing a bug. As Panic Button is in a Beta testing phase we expect that the app will still have technical bugs on some mobile devices. You can help us to fix these problems by reporting a bug to us [**here**](https://report.panicbutton.io/).\n\n**5.\tMy contacts are receiving an alert message but are not seeing my location, what should I do?**\n\nIn order to send the map link with your location, your mobile devise must be able to connect with the phone’s GPS or alternatively detect a nearby cellphone tower.\n\nOcassionally the phone is unable to do either in which case your alert message will appear but without sending your location.\n\nIf this is happening to you frequently check the following:\n\n1.\tThat you have enabled GPS through your phone’s settings. See [**here**](http://www.droid-life.com/2013/01/30/how-to-enable-gps-and-other-location-services-beginners-guide/) for help on how to do this.\n2.\tThat you have enabled Panic Button to access your phone’s GPS.

(or Panic Button).
