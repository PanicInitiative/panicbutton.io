  "0000-01-01-pact-cards-15-ingo-rep.md---bio": "You work for one of the biggest human rights INGOs in the world, which has a regional office in the country. You try to maintain good connections with members of civil society and part of your remit is realising an organisational priority on HRD protection (both preventative and responsive).",
  "0000-01-01-pact-cards-15-ingo-rep.md---power": "You can mobilize your colleagues to quickly get a public statement released about security incidents against HRDs and the impact of said incidences on the health of civil society. ",
  "0000-01-01-pact-cards-15-ingo-rep.md---hard_mode": "- How has the information been verified? - Is there a photo? Is there consent to use that photo? - Background information about the work of the HRD (i.e. geographic, thematic, target groups, etc). You can argue that the work of the HRD has to fit into the strategic direction of the INGO or you wouldn’t be able to prioritise putting out a statement. - You can explain  that you are worried they will want more than a public statement but that you and your team wouldn’t have the capacity to do any further work.",
