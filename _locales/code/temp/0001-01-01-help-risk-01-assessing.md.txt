First, assess your risk. Only you know how security conscious you need to be. The consequences of surveillance and harassment have the potential to be severe; but, being overly cautious and constantly preparing for the worst can be debilitating. Ask yourself, what threats do you face? How serious would it be if that threat became reality? How likely is that to happen?

**The likelihood that you aren't ready for a threat, and that it will become a reality is risk. Many factors affect your risk. Planning for these factors will help you to defend against risk.**
