You and your colleagues are often under surveillance: you are being followed, your office is bugged and the authorities carry out active network mapping of your circles. Your colleagues and partners have received threats in the past, and you believe your adversaries have the power/capacity to act on these threats. You have been taking a greater interest in your own personal security, especially when travelling to remote areas.",
