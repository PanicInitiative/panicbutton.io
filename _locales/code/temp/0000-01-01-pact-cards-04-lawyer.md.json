For proof of this you will need to locate the warden at the local police station and obtain a **visitors’ badge**.\n\nThis will not be easy: the officer will make it as difficult as possible. If you want to retrieve the visitors’ badge you will need to prepare ahead of time. Ensure you note down important personal information about the human rights defender and what you know about the circumstances of their disappearance, so that you are able to negotiate to obtain the visitors’ badge.\n\nThe Warden will be wearing a name tag and there will be a sign advertising the detention centre.\n\nNegotiate to get a visitors badge. Once you have this you can reconvene with the other responders in your team and bring evidence of each task to the Game Masters.\n"
