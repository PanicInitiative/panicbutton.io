Understanding who the actors are, what they can do for (and against) you, and planning beforehand is as important as learning how to use the app.\n\nWe created a set of workshop activity cards for communities and HRD trainers, based on the methodology Amnesty International fine-tuned over months of assisting communities-at-risk to integrate the Panic Button into their work. The cards are meant to be used in 1-2 day workshops with a medium-sized group (20-30 participants), but the cards can also be used separately from one another.\n\nYou can browse the cards online, or print them for use in workshops. We appreciate feedback: please let us know how the cards have been useful for you, and how they can be improved to better fit your needs.\n"
