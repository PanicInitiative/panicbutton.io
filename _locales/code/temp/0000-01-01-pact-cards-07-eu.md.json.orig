For example, has the HRD ever been invited to EU or Embassy events? Has anyone in the DipCore ever visited their office or made public appearances with them? - Claim that the EU (nor any embassy) can't take action unless there's already an Urgent Action or Public statement by a large, well-respected human rights NGO/INGO.",
