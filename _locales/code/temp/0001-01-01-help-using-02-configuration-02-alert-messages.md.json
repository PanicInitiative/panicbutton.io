  "0001-01-01-help-using-02-configuration-02-alert-messages.md---content": "\nIt is best to agree the content of this message in a conversation with your contacts. Remember that the mobile networks that allow you to send an SMS are not built to protect your privacy or the content of your messages. This is true for all calls and SMS communications you make, including SMS alerts sent by Panic Button. \n\nIf you think that those who are threatening you have the power to intercept your SMS communications, you may want to decide a code word or phrase instead of saying ‘help!’ . The most important thing is that your contacts know what the message means and how you would like them to act.\n\nIf you have GPS enabled your message will attach a Google Map link in the SMS that your contacts receive. This message will send every 5 minutes by default. You can change the frequency of the messages when the app is alerting. Enter the app home screen by dismissing the disguise screen and entering your PIN. From the home screen click Settings>>Alert frequency. \n\nThings to think about:\n\n- You won't have time to change a message in an emergency so make sure your alert message makes sense in a number of potential situations. It is a good idea to change it routinely before entering a situation in which you may be at risk.\n- Remember to enable GPS in your phone settings if you want your location to be sent to your contacts. Remember that if you enable GPS, anyone with the power to intercept your SMS communications could also see your location information.\n\n![Create your alert message]({{ site.JB.BASE_PATH }}/media/Screenshot_2014-03-06-12-49-06.png)\n"
