<ul>
<li>A good explanation of what happened, the circumstances of the disappearance/detention, etc. (including about how they found out about it, i.e. the Panic Button)</li>
<li>Why do they think that the disappearance/detention was connected to the fact that the person is actually a HRD?</li>
<li>Has the HRD given consent for the information about the incident to be communicated so widely?</li>
<li>Is there any risk in naming the HRD in the communication?</li>
</ul>
